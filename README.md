# Open-Source-Game-Mechanics---Unity
This repository is created to house Different plug and play game mechanics like dash , mono singleton generic , Utils script and Drag drop etc. These are the mechanics that many games use &amp; does not make sense to always be created from scratch hence a central repo for all the mechanics . 
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Mechanics List - 

1. MonoSingleton Generic - This allows the developer to make any script into a singleton just by inheriting this Script. so all you need to do is class GameManager : MonoSingletonGeneric<GameManager> & voila GameManager is a singleton now

2. Generic And Scalable Dialogue System - This dialogue system helps developers build flexible and scalable conversations in games using ScriptableObjects. It keeps everything organized, makes it easier to add branching choices, and separates data from logic so updates don’t break the flow. You can quickly add new dialogue without writing extra code and without messing with the core system. It’s clean, modular, and saves a lot of time during both development and future updates.
